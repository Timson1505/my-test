                        Sadyr Japarov is the current president of Kyrgyzstan, but his road to the top was not easy. He was born in 1968 in the Ysyk-Kol region.
                        His family was poor, so he had to work hard from a young age. He studied well at school and graduated from university, because he wanted to help
                        his country.<br><br> Later, he worked in politics. S. Japarov became a member of parliament, but he had many enimies. In 2012, he was arrested
                        because of a political protest. He went to jail for several years. It was a very hard time for him, because his father and son died during this period.
                        He could not even attend the funerals, so it hurt him deeply.<br><br> In 2020, the people protested again. They wanted a change, so they freed Japarov from the prison.
                        Then, he became a Prime Minister first, but the situation was difficult. Later, he was elected as a President of the country.<br><br>
                        Now, Sadyr Japarov works to bring peace. Many people respect him because he stayed strong in difficult times. His story is not perfect, but it shows how one person 
                        can sorvive and lead.
